## What is Dosei?

Dosei is a container orchestration platform built around several key principles that set it apart from other solutions:

- **Local-First Architecture** - Dosei prioritizes the local development experience by providing developers with comprehensive programming language capabilities to manage infrastructure. This means you can run 100% offline while maintaining full compatibility—your local setup works seamlessly when deployed to remote clusters.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Core** - IaC isn't an afterthought but a fundamental design principle, ensuring all infrastructure is defined, versioned, and managed through code.

- **Language Agnostic** - Dosei provides SDKs in different programming languages. Currently, it only supports JavaScript, but it doesn't lock you into a custom IaC language.

- **GitOps-First Approach** - All changes flow through Git workflows, providing clear audit trails and collaborative change management.

- **Read-Only Dashboard** - Unlike other PaaS or cloud providers, Dosei's dashboard is intentionally read-only. All modifications must be made through code, enforcing consistency and preventing configuration drift.

This approach ensures that your infrastructure remains predictable, auditable, and aligned with modern DevOps best practices.

## Vision

We're building Dosei to be intuitive and extensible. Our goal is to create infrastructure that is tightly coupled with your application and runs local-first.

While we have core functionality in place and have prototyped various extensions, we're actively seeking community input on where and how to implement additional extensibility.
