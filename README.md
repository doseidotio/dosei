## What is Dosei?

Dosei is an open-source platform that makes deploying web applications simple and portable. It functions as an infrastructure runtime designed specifically for developers, offering:

- Zero downtime deployments with automatic SSL provisioning and renewal
- Language-agnostic Infrastructure as Code
- First-class local development experience
- Secure, scalable, and cost-effective deployments
- Extensible architecture

## Vision

We're building Dosei to be intuitive and extensible. Our goal is to create a platform that developers can easily understand, use, and customize to their needs.

While we have core functionality in place and have prototyped various extensions, we're actively seeking community input on where and how to implement additional extensibility.
